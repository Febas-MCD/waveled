## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [https://github.com/FelSeb-Team/waveled.git]`
2. Create enviroment: `make create_environment`
3. Install the dependencies: `make requirements`
4. Create the necessary folders: `make folders`
5. Run the Makefile Data Downloader: `make download_data`
6. (Windows only): manually extract "waveled\data\raw\features.tar.gz" with a software that can handle non case-sensitive files (such as .7zip), move the resulting folders 'bal_train, eval, unbal_train' into the '/raw' path, and erase the used .tar.gz file

### Available Commands
To list all available commands in the Makefile, run: `make help`

## Data Sources

The data used in this project comes from:

- [AudioSet](https://research.google.com/audioset/): AudioSet by Google.
